# IDEACKERS

Welcome to Ideackers! This project was developed for the ISTD Hackathon to gamify the learning experience and make skill development fun and engaging.

## Documentation

### Problem Statement

**Objective:** Make training fun and engaging through game-based frameworks.

The gamification track focuses on transforming traditional training methods into engaging, game-like experiences. Participants are encouraged to integrate elements like rewards, challenges, and competition into learning environments to drive motivation and improve knowledge retention.

### Challenges in Learning

- The traditional way of learning is often ineffective due to the short attention span of learners.
- Primitive learning methods decrease retention time and power.
- Lack of fun in learning leads to a higher dropout rate among employees and students.
